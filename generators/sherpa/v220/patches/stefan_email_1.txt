Hi Taylor, Tom,

attached the patches we were talking about yesterday: one for aggregating the small MPI messages in CS_Dipole, Process_Integrator and Single_Virtual_Correction, and one for buffered file readin. Apply as usual in the top-level directory of Sherpa with

 patch -p0 < buffered_readin_1.patch
 patch -p0 < mpi_aggregate_1.patch
 make install

I constructed these patches for release 2.2.0, which has the new MPI communication strategy, using Allreduce. They should also work for a patched 2.1.1, but I have not yet tested it.

However, because of time constraints I'd prefer to work on a 2.2.0 for these tests anyhow. It will save the extra hassle of upgrading the fixes to the new release version later on ;)

Let me know how the timing tests go.

Cheers
Stefan
