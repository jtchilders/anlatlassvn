attached the patch. This will be included in our next official version (whenever that may be released). The speedups and memory savings are substantial, so please don't use a plain 2.2.0 (except to figure out that you don't want to use it ;)). The patch also reduces usage of the Data_Reader, which helps speed up initialization as well. For example, in Examples/V_plus_Jets/LHC_ZJets I get (using LJET:=0 to check only Comix)

plain 2.2.0:
 pocess generation -> 200 MB, 1h 11m 25s
  run init -> 196 MB, 59s
  patched 2.2.0:
   pocess generation -> 135 MB, 28m 56s
    run init -> 131 MB, 16s

    What you're interested in is the run init, and you can see that already for Z+4j we get a speedup of factor 4. In the patched version Comix also computes much faster, though not faster than in 2.1.1.

    Part of the improvements also work for Amegic, i.e. the startup time should be reduced overall. Let me know how well this works for you.

    Cheers
