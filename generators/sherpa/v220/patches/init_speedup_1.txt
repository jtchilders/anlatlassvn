Hi Tom^2, Taylor,

I've recently worked quite a bit on the initialization part of Comix, and I would hope that most of the problems in LO (and LO ME+PS) setups are gone. For SUSY simulations you cannot use Amegic anyways, so these initializations should be fast.

I'd be curious if the problems on Mira persist after my latest patches for rel-2.2.0. I've managed to get one more speedup (aditional patch for rel-2.2.0 attached), which brings the initialization time for LO W+6j to 3s on my laptop (from ~17min before, and after the Process directory is present, of course ;)).

The remaining issue is Amegic, and I cannot do much about it at the moment, so if you are trying to run a lot of MEPS@NLO sims my latest changes won't be the remedy just yet (but I'll keep thinking about it). In this case I think that Cori in its present form would be a good alternative (possibly using the burst buffer, I haven't checked that out myself).

I have not yet had the chance to benchmark my latest changes on Mira, so if you let me know in case they don't help (enough), I'll go and debug ...

Thanks and Cheers
Stefan
