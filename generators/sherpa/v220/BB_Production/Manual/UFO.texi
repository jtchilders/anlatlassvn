To use a model generated by the FeynRules package
@mycite{Christensen2008py},@mycite{Christensen2009jx}, the model must be
made available to Sherpa by running
@verbatim
  <prefix>/bin/Sherpa-generate-model <path-to-ufo-model>
@end verbatim
where <path-to-ufo-model> specifies the location of the directory where
the UFO model can be found. This requires Python version 2.6 or later
and an installation of SCons. Furthermore, Sherpa must be compiled with
Python suppert using @option{--enable-pyext}, as described in
@xref{Installation}.

The above command generates source code for the UFO model, compiles it,
and installs the corresponding library, making it available for event
generation. Python, SCons, and the UFO model directory are not required
for event generation once the above command has finished.

An example run card will be written to the working directory while the
model is generated with @code{Sherpa-generate-model}. This run card
shows the syntax for the respective model parameters and can be used as
a template. It is also possible to use an external parameter card by
specifying the path to the card with the switch @option{UFO_PARAM_CARD}
in the @code{(run)@{...@}(run)} section of the run card. Relative and
absolute file paths are allowed. This option allows it to use the native
UFO parameter cards, as used by MadGraph for example.

Note that the SM switches @option{MASS[<id>]}, @option{YUKAWA[<id>]},
@option{MASSIVE[<id>]}, @option{WIDTH[<id>]}, @option{PRIORITY[<id>]},
etc. have no effect in UFO models as the UFO model completely defines
all particle properties and their relation to the independent model
parameters. Sherpa does however use internal default values for the
Standard Model fermion masses in parts of the simulation other than the
hard process if they are massless in the UFO model. This is necessary
for a meaningful simulation. In the hard process however, the UFO model
masses are always respected.

For an example UFO setup, see @ref{MSSM/UFO}. For more details on the
Sherpa interface to FeynRules please consult
@mycite{Christensen2009jx},@mycite{Hoeche2014kca}.

Please note that AMEGIC can only be used for the built-in models (SM and
HEFT). The use of UFO models is only supported by Comix.

@c The MSSM is implemented via UFO, cf.

@c In order to use this model, Sherpa must be installed with python support,
