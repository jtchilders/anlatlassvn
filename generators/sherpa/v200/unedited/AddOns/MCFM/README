In order to make this work:

- Add a "-fPIC" flag to the Fortran makefile in the MCFM subdirectory.
- Copy "process.DAT" from MCFM/MCFM/Bin to the run directory
- Run "make" in the QCDloop directory
- Apply the W1jet patch already there -- we'll have to merge patches 
  into one ....
- Produce a H1jet patch --- essentially replace epinv**2 with epinv2
- Produce a H2jet patch --- essentially replace epinv**2 with epinv2
- Make scheme "dred" for H2jet and H1jet - must hack MCFM .....
