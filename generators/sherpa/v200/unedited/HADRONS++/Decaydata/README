There are two scripts:
    a) make old
       makeold
       renames all <name>.dat.old files into <name>.dat
       it only searches in current directory and its subdirectories, 
       i.e. ./ and ./*/ but nut ./*/*/ etc.
    b) make clean
       makeclean
       deletes the last three line of a <name>.dat file
       if it contains the keyword Result,
       i.e. it deletes old results so that Sherpa reintegrates
       in a rerun.
       Note: the old file is saved under <name>.dat.old; it can be
       reproduced using makeold.

NOTE! .dat filenames must not contain dots, i.e. they must have the 
      structure <name>.dat, where <name> does not have any dots(.) !
      This is important for the makeold script.
