Things to notice:
@itemize
@item The matrix elements are interfaced from @mycite{FebresCordero2006sj}.
  The shared library necessary for running this setup is built using
  @uref{http://www.scons.org/,,scons}.
@item The W-boson is stable in the hard matrix elements.
  It is decayed using the internal decay module, indicated by
  the settings @option{HARD_DECAYS 1} and @option{STABLE[24] 0}.
@item @uref{http://www.fastjet.fr/,,FastJet} is used to regularize the hard cross section. 
  Note that Sherpa must be configured with option @option{--enable-fastjet}, see
  @ref{Fastjet selector}. We require two b-jets, indicated by the @option{2} 
  at the end of the @option{FastjetFinder} options.
@item Four-flavour PDF's are used to comply with the calculational setup.
