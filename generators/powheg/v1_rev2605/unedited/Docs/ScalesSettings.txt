The scale choice is POWHEG is usually a function of the UNDERLYING BORN kinematics.
That means, for example, that in W or Z or H production the pt of the boson is not
available for scale setting purposes. There is, however, a way to set the scale
in a totally generic way (but you should know what you are doing, if you are trying this!)

Set the flag:

btlscalereal 1

in the powheg.input file. Then edit the set_fac_ren_scales(muf,mur) subroutine
in the user process, and set the scales as follows:

   if(flg_btlscalereal) then
     ...
c here set the scales as a function of the real momenta, kn_cmpreal(0:3,1:nlegreal)
     ...
   else
c here set the scales as a function of the underlying Born momenta, kn_cmpborn(0:3,1:nlegborn)
     ...
   endif

The monenta have dimension: p(0:3), with 0 being the time component. In order to know how the
partons are labelled, look at the init_processes file in the process dependent directory.

Notice that in this way the real counter-event is computed with the same scale as the real
event. In order to use the scale evaluated at its own kinematics, add the flag:

btlscalect 1

in the powheg.input file.
