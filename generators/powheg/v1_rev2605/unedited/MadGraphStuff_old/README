Use the BuildMad.sh script;
Create a directory under POWHEG-BOX and cd into it.
do:
$ cp ../MadGraphStuff/Cards/proc_card.dat .
Edit proc_card.dat, and insert the process you want to generate,
including radiation, i.e. the real emission process.

do:

$../MadGraphStuff/BuildMad.sh


The Born_phsp.f, and the virtual.f are place holders. The user must
provide the Born phase space and the virtual matrix elements.




The procedure step by step:

(Copy the whole MadGraphStuff tree to a new location.)

$ cd MadGraphStuff

$ edit MadGraphStuff/Cards/proc_card.dat

Set the process as in madgraph. Always enter the real emission
process, i.e. the born process plus one j.
For example, for the Z, enter pp > e- e+ j. Remember also to set the
QCD coupling appropriate for the real emission process.

Set the model of your choice:
sm (standard model with diagonal CKM)
smckm  (standard model with vud vus vcd vcd CKM)
heft   (standard model with Higgs production effective vertex)

$ ./NewProcess.sh

Use:

$ ./NewProcess.sh -g

if you want to compile with debug information and no optimization.

You will find in the current directory:

Born.f
real.f
init_couplings.f
coupl.inc
Cards/param_card.dat

A file Born_phsp.f and virtual.f must be provided by the user to complete
the POWHEG implementation, that can be compiled with

$make pwhg_main
