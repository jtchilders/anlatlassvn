GoSam - MadGraph - POWHEG interface

To generate a new process follow these steps:

1. create a new folder for the new process you want to generate in the main POWHEG-BOX directory

2. write a MadGraph input card and, if needed, a GoSam input card (gosam.rc) and save them in the new process folder

3. generate the tree amplitudes and POWHEG-BOX files by executing:
   ../MadGraphStuff/BuildMad.sh

   from the new folder, where you want to generate the process.

4. generate the loop-amplitudes by executing:
   ../GoSamStuff/BuildGS virtual
   ../GoSamStuff/BuildGS newfiles
   ../GoSamStuff/BuildGS standalone
 
5. at this point a complete Makefile is available for compilation.

6. to run the process the file Born_phsp.f has to be provided.

--> Further modifications could be needed in 

- Gosamlib/olp_module (for dynamical parameters)
- pwhg_analysis.f (has to be provided)
- init_couplings.f (to be edited to parallel runs)
- charge conjugated processes are not automated (have to be implemented)
