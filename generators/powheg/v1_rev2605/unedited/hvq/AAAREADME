This is The BOX version of the POWHEG-hvq package.
The output of the BOX version should be equivalent
(within statistics) to the POWHEG-hvq version.
There are slight changes of syntax in the powheg
input files. Samples are given in the example
directories c-lhc, c-tev, b-lhc, b-tev, tde-lhc,
t-dec.

Only one example analysis file is provided for now,
that deals with top, and was used to test the
equivalence with the POWHEG-hvq version.
The Makefile targets pwhg_main-top and lhef_analysis-top
use this analysis files.
The pwhg_main is a generic program for the generation of
a Les Houches file for either charm, top or bottom. It
does not perform any NLO analysis.
