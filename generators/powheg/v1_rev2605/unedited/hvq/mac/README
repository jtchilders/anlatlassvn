The programs ggvfin.mac and qqvfin.mac construct the finite part of
the virtal cross section Vfin, as defined in the FNO, in the BOX, and
in the MadFKS paper. The starting point is the formula for the virtual
corrections of NDE, encoded in the arrays totdel0, totdel1,
totdel2. These are the coefficients of the 1, 1/ep and 1/ep^2
terms. The NDE virtual term is computed in dimensional regularization. The
spin average factors are included in d dimension (i.e. a factor 1/(1-ep)^2
for the gg process is included). The flux factor is included.
It is normalized as follows:

d sigma = N * totdel/(2*s) * delta(tx) * d phi1 
           = N * totdel/(2*s) * s/(2 pi) * 2 pi delta(s*tx) * d phi1
           = N * totdel/(4 pi) d phi2,

where N is given by

          (4 pi)^ep Gamma(1+ep)
      N = --------------------  (m2/mu^2)^(-ep)
              (4 pi)^2

According to the conventions of FNO and of the BOX paper, the infinite
part of the virtual should be normalized to

          (4 pi)^ep
         -----------
         Gamma(1-ep)

assuming that the Ellis-Sexton scale has been taken equal to mu. Thus,
up to the overall 1/(4 pi)^2 factor, we should supply the factor

  Gamma(1+ep)*gamma(1-ep)*(m2/mu^2)^(-ep) = (1+pi^2 ep^2/6)*(m2/mu^2)^(-ep) 

to bring the virtual correction into the desired normalization.
