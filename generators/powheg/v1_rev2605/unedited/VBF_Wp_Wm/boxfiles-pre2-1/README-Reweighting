This files allow the storage of reweighting information in the .lhe
file. It works as follows.

At the moment, you must edit the process Makefile, set the VPATH
with the ReweightingStuff directory as the first directory to search,
and set the include paths to serch this directory before the others.
Add the dependencies pwhgreweight.o and opencount.o to the pwhg_main
target, and compile.

Later on all the changes will be merged with the trunk, and the reweighting
options will be available with no further work.


1) Run pwhg_main with the line

storeinfo_rwgt 1

in the powheg.input file. The program will run as usual, but it will add
a line beginning with
#rwg 
at the end of each event, containing informations that are necessary for
reweighting.

To obtain new weights, corresponding to different pdf's or scale choice,
comment away the evreweight line, and insert the line

compute_rwgt 1

in the powheg.input file. Modify the powheg.input to use the different pdf's
and scale factors, and run pwhg_main. Now a new event file, named as
OriginalName-rwgt.lhe is created, with the same events as the original
OriginalName.lhe file, but with a line added to the end of each event,
of the form
 #new weight,renfact,facfact,pdf1,pdf2 <new weight> <new ren. scale factor> \
<new fact rscale fact> < new pdf # for hadron 1> <new pdf number for hadron 2>
<'mlm' or 'lha'>
where the last string specifies if the native pdf package was used (with its
own numbering scheme, or the lhapdf package.

The script runexample.sh illustrate the procedure with an example for building
reweighting information for 6 more combinations of scale variations.
