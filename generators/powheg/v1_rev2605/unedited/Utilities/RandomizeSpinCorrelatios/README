This program can be used to randomize the spin correlation of decaying
resonances. In order to use it, identify the position of the
decaying resonances in the Les Houches event file. Run the
program, anter as requested the name of the input event file, the name
of the output event file, and the position of each resonance, terminated
by a negative integer. The program should handle nested resonances.
