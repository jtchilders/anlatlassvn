*********      README for WGRAD2 in POWHEG-W_EW USAGE  *************
*******************************************************************

This README describes the usage of flags for the EW corrections of
WGRAD2 as implemented in POWHEG-W_EW. The flags described below are
contained in the powheg.input file. Additional WGRAD2 settings can be
found in virtual_EW.f, which should not be changed unless the user is
confident about their impact.

For questions related to the EW part please contact:

=========|========================|
  FLAG          USAGE                         
=========|========================|
 ewonly    1: only EW corrections  
              all NLO QCD pieces 
              zeroed
           0: include QCD pieces
=========|=================================================================|
NOTICE:
=========|=================================================================|
This flag allows the user to ONLY include the NLO EW corrections.  
This is equivalent to only running WGRAD2. 
!!! NOTE !!!: the user cannot use showering with the event file 
produced during this run!!  The resulting files 'pwgNLO.top' and 
'pwgpwhgalone-output.top' which correspond to the weighted and unweighted 
exact NLO result (respectively) are the ONLY files that should be utilized 
for a run when ewonly is set to 1.
=========|========================|
  FLAG          USAGE                         
=========|========================|
 wgrad2    1: include EW corrections
           0: do no include EW 
              corrections 
=========|========================|
  FLAG          USAGE                         
=========|========================|
 QED       1: IS QED radiation
           2: FS QED radiation
           3: interference QED 
              radiation
           4: all QED radiation

  FLAG          USAGE                         
=========|========================|
 qnonr     1: non-resonant W
              production
           0: resonant W production
=========|=================================================================|
NOTICE:
=========|=================================================================|
If qnonr=1, then QED must be set to 4.

  FLAG          USAGE                         
=========|========================|
 lfc       1: QED DIS factorization 
              scheme
           0: QED MSbar factorization 
              scheme
=========|========================|
  FLAG          USAGE                         
=========|========================|
 bare      1: include bare cuts
           0: no bare cuts
=========|=================================================================|
NOTICE:
=========|=================================================================|
If bare=1, then the cuts below are applied. The cuts are applied only
when the subroutine analysis is called (in pwhg_analysis.f), where the
histograms are filled. The corresponding total cross section is
provided in pwgNLO.top.  The total cross section printed on the screen
when running POWHEG-W_EW does not reflect the cuts.
=========|========================|
  FLAG          USAGE                         
=========|========================|
 cut1      set to desired minimum transverse momentum of charged lepton
 cut2      set to desired minimum transverse momentum of neutrino
 cut3      set to desired maximum value of |pseudorapidity| of charged lepton
=========|========================|
  FLAG          USAGE                         
=========|========================|
 calo      1: include calometric cuts
           0: no calo cuts
=========|=================================================================|
NOTICE:
=========|=================================================================|
Setting calo=1 can only be used in combination with the setting bare=1
with the cut1,2,3 values as set by the user.  Currently the calometric
setup includes Gaussian smearing of final-state particles a la D0
(Tevatron) or ATLAS (LHC) as well as a recombination of
electron and photon, see arXiv:0705.3251 (page 154) for more details of
the recombination procedure.  The smearing routines can be found in
smear_routines.f.  In the electron case the setting calo=1 should
not be used in combination with showering. If collcut=1 is
chosen in virtual_EW.f, a recombination procedure has to be performed
(default is collcut=0). The calometric setup also includes cuts on the
separation between the photon and charged lepton. They are applied
only to the real hard QED radiation part in real_EW.f.
