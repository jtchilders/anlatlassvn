This files are needed to implement the MINLO prescription.
This is an experimental feature, to be used with care.


In order to do MINLO in a process of the kind:

h h -> heavy particles + n jets

you should do the following: link all the MINLO *.h and *.f
files to the process directory:

**************** 1 *************

POWHEG-BOX$ cd MyProcess
POWHEG-BOX/MyProcess$ for file in ../MINLO/*.f  ../MINLO/*.h ; \
do ln -s $file . ; done

**************** 2 *************

Edit the process Makefile, and add setlocalscales.o to the PWHG variable.


**************** 3 *************

Edit the init_processes.f file, and add the following lines at the
beginning of the init_processes subroutine:

      if(powheginput("#minlo").eq.1) then
         flg_minlo=.true.
      else
         flg_minlo=.false.
      endif

      st_bornorder=<m>

where <m> is the power of alpha_s associated with the h h -> heavy particles
(with no jets) process. In the Higgs + 1 or 2 jets example, we have m=2.

With the above lines minlo is activated by a "minlo 1" line in the powheg.input
file. If you want it to be always on, add instead

      flg_minlo=.true.


**************** 4 *************

Edit the Born_phsp.f file, and look at the set_fac_ren_scales. While using
minlo, this routine should use a fixed scale, i.e. it should always set
muf and mur to a constant value. This option is usually available as
a variable "runningscales" or "fixedscale" in the powheg.input file.
If not, simply edit the set_fac_ren_scales routine to make it return a
constant value.


**************** 5 *************

The user should provide an extra function, validflav(lflav), and
include it in the init_processes.f file, or in any other process file.
The purpose of this function is to make sure that after each clustering
in the kt-cl;ustering procedure, we are left with a consistent
flavour structure. For example, in q qbar -> H g, if we cluster
the icoming quark with a gluon, we are left with q qbar -> H, which has
no cross section.
lflav is an integer list of flavours for the process, labelled according
to the PDG numbering scheme, except that the gluon is 0 (according to
POWHEG conventions). The entries that have already been clustered away
are set to 1000000. An example for the Higgs + n jets case is included
in the MINLO/examples subdirectory.

The Higgs case is the only case that we are aware of so far where
this routine is needed. In Z and W production, this routine can
safely always return true.
